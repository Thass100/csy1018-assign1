    <h1 class="heading1">CV</h1>



    <p2> I am very motivated and enthusiastic in whatever I take part in as I believe hard work pays off. I am confident with communicating with employers and colleagues as I work well in a team. I strongly believe and understand the importance of teamwork
        as it is an effective way to achieve goals and targets. I am very much self-motivated as I like to use my initiative when dealing with employers, colleagues and clients. I am also open minded when it comes to working in different environments,
        this helps me work to my full potential and adapt to my surroundings. I have also learnt how to manage my time effectively which means I am always on time and can prioritise certain tasks and meet deadlines. My experiences have also taught me
        how to become independent which means I can accept and take care of my responsibilities. I have also developed my creative side as I am always looking for new ideas to better my work. Studying I.T has also enhanced my programming skills as I am
        confident with using HTML.
    </p2>
    <h3> Education </h3>
    <p3>Before starting my undergraduate course at the university of Northampton, I studied I.T level 2&3 at Bedford college. This was the foundation of my knowledge as it taught me the important aspects of computing. There were modules within this course
        which covered many areas of I.T. It was during my studies at college where I realised my passion for technology. This was when I realised Iâ€™d like to pursue further education. These are modules I had studied while at college:
    </p3>
    <br>
    <p4>Web Development-Distinction</p4>
    <p5>Communication Technology-Distinction</p5>
    <p6>Troubleshoot and I.T Repair-Distinction</p6>
    <p7>I.T Technical Support-Distinction</p7>
    <p8>Digital Graphics-Distinction</p8>
    <p9>Spreadsheet Modelling-Distinction</p9>


    <h3>Professional Experience</h3>

    <p10> I held down two jobs as well as one day of work experience while completing my diploma. One of the best decisions I have made was to take part in 70 hours of un-paid work experience at Barclays Bank. This built the foundation of my skill set and it
        has made me very confident with tackling any problems that come my way. During my time at Barclays I took part in a scheme called 'life skills' where I worked through a series of activities learning new skills. I was also a team leader in my local
        youth centre where my team and I had to create a welcoming environment to attract the younger generation. This also taught me many skills because I had to be very organised to create and maintain events such as day trips, motivational speaking
        and group activities. I have an insight to the complex world as I have been working two jobs as well as completing my studies. One of the part time jobs was working at a market research company as a telephone interviewer where I really learnt
        about the world of research and marketing. </10>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p11> I was able to learn how to control respondents over the phone which has now given me the confidence to communicate with anyone and everyone. I also worked at Sainsbury's, where I gained knowledge of the vital importance of customer service. I
            am really determined and enthusiastic to attend university because I am keen on taking advantages of all the opportunities that higher education can offer me. I really like the idea of student societies as I can get involved in a number of
            things. Although university provides great education I also want to go to become independent within myself so I can get ready for the working world where I will have to adapt to living or working in places where I'd have to be independent.</p11>
